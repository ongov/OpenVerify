- [Local setup](#local-setup)

## Overview

This is a React Native app and designed to work well on both Android and iOS devices.

Open Verify gives businesses and organizations a quick, easy and trusted way to scan and confirm that visitors are fully vaccinated.

The app scans the QR code on an Ontario government-issued vaccine certificate.

After scanning a QR code, the business or organization will see: a green checkmark indicating that it meets vaccine requirements, a red X for an invalid certificate, or a yellow warning indicating that the QR code cannot be read.

Open Verify also scans most government issued QR codes from British Columbia and Québec. Nation-wide capabilities are in development and will be added as provinces issue proof of vaccination with SMART® Health Card QR codes.
